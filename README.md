# *Sweatin' & Spreadsheets: An Analysis of Exercise Efforts* :running: :sweat_drops: :weight_lifting_woman: 

In this project, we embark on a journey through a vast dataset, harnessing the tools of SQL, and the agility of Jupyter Nootebook to mold and manipulate our data. Our mission? To sculpt and reshape the dataset into meaningful insights, employing prowess of Pandas and other Python libraries along the way.

#### Data Preparation and  Tasks
For this project, we carefully curated data sourced from Kaggle. After refining the raw data into a more manageable format, we converted it into CSV files. Our subsequent actions included importing this data into SQL databases, establishing a robust foundation for in-depth analysis within Jupyter Notebook. Through meticulous cleaning and merging processes, we ensured data cohesion, guaranteeing that it is primed and prepared for thorough analytical exploration.
